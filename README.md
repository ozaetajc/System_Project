Description: 
     This project aims to provide a user-friendly and streamlined enrollment system that will help the students to enroll and provide the administrators monitor student enrollees at Lord Immanuel Institute Foundation Inc. Specifically, here are the key objectives of this Enrollment System: <br>
     1) To collect and store accurate student information, including personal details, academic records, and contact information. <br>
     2) To reduce manual data entry and paper works for students and school administrators. <br>
     3) To enable real-time update on enrollment status and tuition fee assessment to enhance the communication between the school administrator and students.

<br>

SDG 
<br>
The Lord Immanuel Institute Foundation Inc. is a school located in Lobo Batangas. We know that other schools are already using an electronic enrollment system. However, the LIIFI school currently uses a manual system for recording and retrieving students' information. Students also get confused in the confirmation of the enrollment, some of them attend classes not knowing that they are not enrolled. Therefore, proponents aim to improve the old manual system of LIIFI by proposing a computer-based enrollment system to provide a solution to the problems that they encountered in operating its manual enrollment. The proposed system aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 8 (8.2) which promotes decent work and economic growth. To promote sustained, inclusive employment and decent work for all. This project aims to help the client by providing them with a platform that will streamline the process of the enrollment system. The web-based enrollment system will eliminate the need for physical enrollment making it convenient for the students to enroll anywhere as long as they have an internet connection. The system aims to achieve higher levels of economic productivity by focusing on high-value-added and labor-intensive sectors.<br> By applying this plan, the enrollment system could be important in promoting sustainable development and achieving SDG 8.
